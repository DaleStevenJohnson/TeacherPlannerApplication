Codebase
- Use StringFormat in Datetime bindings for WPF controls instead of string properties
- Update enums to use extension method with dictionary (see KeyDateTypes) rather than big switch statements.

Database Implementation

+ Add Database models
+ Change KeyDateItemViewModel to contain an ObservableCollection of KeyDateItemModels

Days Refactor
+ Change period control & notes control to one text box rather than 7
+ Add Methods to Database manager for Update, Select and Insert.
+ Add reg period & ensure reg classcode is in correct position
+ Ensure Enums are used for periods and days (DayOfWeek).
+ Ensure viewmodel is not being refreshed and Model is the thing which is being updated.

Lesson Sequencer
+ Add user controls
- Change timetable weeks defintions to include all weeks of allowed academic year
- Check for empty days and remove them
+ Add events for when data is updated between the planner and the lesson sequence
- Add saving of data added
- Make the selected lessons cleverer
	- Do not allow dates in defined holiday to appear
	- When scrolling, it should move back and forth on days with that classcode, not just back and forward weekdays
- IDEA - add minimalist timetable to bottom right of page, only displaying lessons for selected classcode.
