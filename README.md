# TeacherPlannerApplication
TeacherPlanner aims to replicate a physical teacher planner. 

This is intended for use by teachers. Developed by a teacher as a way of better understanding application development in c#.

The teacher planner is fully editable, and aims to be as flexible as a physical teacher planner, while automating some of the more laborious tasks, such as filling out classcodes for all lessons.

TeacherPlanner is designed to work with SIMs timetables - import them directly into your chosen academic year and it will be applied across the planner automatically.
